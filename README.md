### its not finished yet, as i have deadline till tommorow evening, but feedback would be appreciated, as the given task is little confusing.

Also, as I haven't really worked much with pytest nor touched a good code written for it, my test cases may be little lacking, but of course that's fixable.

despite the requirement specified in the task, I didn't use OOP for test cases, as it was totally unnecessary for this level and it would just make 
code look more complex for no reason. Honestly, it wasn't even much needed for the server, but I still did it.

main.py - for launching the server via flask

testing.py - test cases for pytest

report.html - generated pytest report
