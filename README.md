# flatrock

### its not finished yet, as i have deadline till tommorow evening, but feedback would be appreciated, as the given task is little confusing.

Also, as I haven't really worked much with pytest nor touched a good code written for it, my test cases may be little lacking, but of course that's fixable.

api_requests.py - class for requests

main.py - for launching the server via flask

test_cases.py - positive test cases 

report.html - generated pytest report


### run by using ---  
```
pytest -s --html=report.html
```
